title: Assumptions and Data
---

As I learn more about the world. I realize most of the functions/learning are ways to figure out how data maps to our assumptions of the world. 

Two ideas I would like to note down about some of my re-learning. 

### Law of large numbers 

In a simplied form, if you have some observations X1,X2,X3,......,X(n), assume they come from the same distribution and are independent(see prior post)

the idea of the law of large numbers, is that as we observe more "things" ---> their average become more stable than the components("things"). example: like a coin toss, we know if you do many tosses (more than a 1000), 50% will be head, and 50% will be tails. 


### The central limit theorem 

In a simplied form, if you have some observations X1,X2,X3,......,X(n), the sum of these components("things") as (n) becomes large, their distribution tends to "look" like a gaussian(normal). 


There are implications to the two ideas above. Alot of the statistics/ ways we map data to our assumptions, assumes a world where the law of large numbers / central limit theorem is in play. However sometimes it's not always the case, and a lot of important events in life are hard to reason about from those two ideas. But they are very important. 


Think twice ---- Study the distribution of outcomes for the system you are dealing with, it helps with mapping data to "our" assumptions of the world to better make decisions.
