            "content": "Being aware of claims of statistical significance . This is a short post on a topic that has recently been malleating slowly in how I think about information, especially “scientific” or data driven results. . Per wikipedia entry, statistical significance is defined as “a result has statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the null hypothesis…..and the p-value of a result, p, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.” . A few housekeeping/definition notes before proceeding: . A null hypothesis – (in my own words, which might not be as accurate) – Some statement you think is the base fact of some situation i.e(obserbation). You can also define it as, observing no difference in a population characteristics or the data that is generated.. (still working on a clear definition). For example – a coin is fair, meaning, over time, heads and tails will be 50%. . An alternative hypothesis – suggests or proposes that, you could observe something different in the base fact of some situation. From the coin is fair example, if we were to observe something that would make us reject the null hypothesis – and say that the coin is not fair. . Hypothesis testing – is having some method to reject or say (f….. you) to the null hypothesis within some confidence level i.e – A lot of science use statistical significance to test confidence level. . All this means, we gather data so that we can either learn nothing and maintain our “null hypothesis”, or we observe something extreme(with some confidence level) to reject the null hypothesis. . Let’s revisit statistical significance. . Saying a result is statistically significant, is asserting that– Look, I have made these observations, I have a feeling if there was nothing going on but some random noise, then the chances are 1/20 or 5% you will see something as extreme or greater. . To put it simply, the chances that I am observing something interesting(that deviates from my null hypothesis) as EXTREME as this and its ALL noise(nonsense, or some shit i don’t know) are so so small. . I hope did this explenation, I am still also still figuring this out, as I believe most people still are and/or confused about the meaning of statisical significance, especially my college professors. And people who claim statistical significance can lead you astray if you don’t have some framework to reason about it. . Now, there is a view that the idea of “statistical significance” to interpret some result might be wrong. Some of the arguments are about the techinicalities, that if nothing was going on (just observing some random noise), the chance of observing/finding something that is “statistically significant”(deviates from some null hypothesis) can actually be much greater that 5%. . I will end the post here, because it is an ongoing discussion among a lot of researchers to figure out better ways to test hypothesis and to come up with better metrics. But I hope this stays as a reminder to always be on the look out of “statistally significant” claims, and how much it can be hard to interpret such results based on the idea of just “signigicance”. .

            "title": "Assumptions and Data",
            "content": "As I learn more about the world. I realize most of the functions/learning are ways to figure out how data maps to our assumptions of the world. . Two ideas I would like to note down about some of my re-learning. . Law of large numbers . In a simplied form, if you have some observations X1,X2,X3,……,X(n), assume they come from the same distribution and are independent(see prior post). . The idea of the law of large numbers is that, as we observe more “things” —&gt; their average become more stable than the components(“things”). example: like a coin toss, we know if you do many tosses (more than a 1000), 50% will be head, and 50% will be tails. . The central limit theorem . In a simplied form, if you have some observations X1,X2,X3,……,X(n), the sum of these components(“things”) as (n) becomes large, their distribution tends to “look” like a gaussian(normal). . There are implications to the two ideas above. Alot of the statistics/ ways we map data to our assumptions, assumes a world where the law of large numbers / central limit theorem is in play. However sometimes it’s not always the case, and a lot of important events in life are hard to reason about from those two ideas. But they are very important. . Think twice —- Study the distribution of outcomes for the system you are dealing with, it helps with mapping data to “our” assumptions to make better decisions. .",

            "title": "Learning about the world -- sampling the world?",
            "content": "The past few weeks have been interesting. Actually the past 10 months have in fact been very interesting. It would be hard to write about some of what I am learning without acknowledging the rise of intense mimetic behavior and eternal search for scapegoats to justify most actions, as Rene Gerard would say. 21st century is the era of the gamification of behavior and actions, and the different unintended mechanisms that arise from the design of these games. . Growing up, I always liked playing games. One of the most joyful times in school was when the bell rang and it was time for recreation(odd that we use to call it that way). Games yield a mechanism that almost all kids learn the ideas of risk and reward. Because of games, most people build up some of the evolutionary competitive nature that is propelled further into living and surviving adulthood. We evolve to learn to filter events, signals or data that facilitate the right predictions and inference for the different actions we take. As the world gets more interconnected and more resources are harnessed to sustain humanity, more data are revealed to us. . Human beings are the ultimate perpetual data collecting systems. Reward and risk being our mechanism of how we collect, process and make use of our data, most times we make decisions and take actions that are very suboptimal and that are detrimental to our inference of a “good” or “useful” life. . In this short essay, I want to explore two ideas: independence and expected value. . A query that will guide this is: Suppose you have some data, how should you use it to learn about the world? . The world is filled with many uncertainties that are empirical and/or epistemological, finding ways to navigate and survive in this world requires some principles for decision making that are idiosyncratic to human intuition. Looking at the world as a set of events with probabilities that lead to certain outcomes that carry some uncertainties, it is possible to better make sense of the world and guide our behavior. . Of the many topics and concepts to cover in statistics and probability, exploring the concepts of independence and expected value, can further add to our tools of decision and navigation. . Independence . Independence in statistics is understood to be that, if knowing a certain event A does not change the probability of event B occurring, then this means they are statistically independent. . Let event A and B be subsets of a sample space, A sample space defining a set of possible outcomes, if event A does not influence B, then they are independent. . A and B are independent if P ( A and B) = P (A) * P(B) . Two events can be physically or logically independent, where neither one implies the other, but still be statistically dependent. . The etymology of the word independence is traced back to the 15th century. Therefore one can assume that it is hard to internalize the idea of independence as a human being, because of our default baseline to look for connections and dependence everywhere. Having a mindset to evaluate events and signals first as independent, can give praxis to assess dependence and interdependence when events occur. . There is much to write about the assumptions of independence as it pertains to statistics, but this short essay is to lay out the idea and build on it over time. And hopefully there is a positive expected value to a better understanding independence. . Expected value . According to wikipedia, expected value is defined as “…a generalization of the weighted average, and is intuitively the arithmetic mean of a large number of independent realizations of X” To easily translate this: If a person does many trials of an experiment, an expected value is a piece of information about what to expect from such an experiment in the long run i.e – over many trials. . An important thing to note about expected values, is to recognize when you are dealing with negative, neutral or positive expected value events. . A negative expected value is when you are expected to lose or be worse off over time/ over many trials. A neutral expected value is when you neither gain or lose over time. A positive expected value is when you are expected to be better off over time. . A caveat however is to recognize that expected values happen over many trials, so it is important to recognize when you are dealing with events where values/possibilities are infrequent. . For this post, I am not going to indulge in geometric expectations or utility, interesting topics for next time. Especially the usefulness of a geometric over an arithmetic expectation as it pertains to expected value and decision making under risk. . In closing, the question still remains. Suppose you have some data, how should you use it to learn about the world? . This is a question I am very much interested in, both intellectually and professionally, it will always come to bear in future posts. This further extends to learning more about networks and graphs, and ways insights about networks and graphs will dominate the behaviors of the 21st century. .

            "content": "I spent a weekend in the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda. I was there to attend a football(soccer) tournament organized by the high schools in the area. I was the captain of my team; therefore, I had a large role to play in planning our game strategy, determining who would play in what position, and deciding how many substitute players would take part in each game. . It was a dreadful weekend, I played as a defensive midfielder, and one of my jobs was to cover as much ground on the football field while the other job was to be the conductor of our team formation. I had to have an acute spatial awareness of the field and the people on it at all times. The game for me was not just physical, it was also mental. . The semi final game was challenging, we were losing 3 goals to 1. As the leader, I tried to keep the team’s morale up even while we were all running on fumes. And to make matters worse, out of nowhere the top scorer on our team got so frustrated that he demanded to be subbed out of the game. For a team already on fumes, this continued to drain our resolve to battle out the rest of the game.. I knew that as the only leader left on the field, my teammates would be looking to me for direction. Unfortunately, this was the moment I made a mistake. This one mistake stays with me even today, as it has taught me a lot about leadership. . As the football game progressed, I was exhausted and saw no path to winning, I made a terrible decision to signal to my teammates that there was no need to put in any more effort into the match, I gave the team permission to act as they pleased and as a result, we lost the game. I was disappointed in myself for not applying effort till the last whistle. I was disappointed that I let my team give up and this decision to give up produced cascading effects. However, this mistake has taught me a major lesson about collective behavior and strategic thinking. . My passion for researching and finding out more about the world around me first manifested in my passion for football (soccer in America). On a soccer field, there is a network structure and a lot of individual behaviors. Spending a lot of time on the soccer field growing up, I learned and observed that there are numerous settings in which a group of people simultaneously choose to act, knowing that the outcome will depend on the decisions made by all of them. . Exploring networks in technology and economic systems continues to be the intellectual center of my interests. The era of information technology has manifested a new medium that almost all aspects of life are organized or self-organized. Understanding structures of different networks, behaviors and dynamics that arise from those networks is necessary for developing better mechanisms for civilized societies. . This post is an introduction to my view of the world. I am hoping to unify different areas that I constantly study such as maths, history, economics, and philosophy to understand the world I am living in. I want to expand my view of the world beyond path-dependency but also as compartments or nodes that shift from center to periphery in the network of humanity and the advent of civilization. I believe approaching different systems with an eye toward their patterns of internal structure and their feedback effects, can open society to solving different problems. This introductory post is my journey to highlight and learn about network structures and behaviors effects in my life. .",
